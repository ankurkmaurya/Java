 *
 *  join() method is generally used to pause the execution of a current thread unless and until the specified thread on which join is called 
 *  is dead or completed. To stop a thread from running until another thread gets ended, this method can be used. 
 *  It joins the start of a thread execution to the end of another threadâ€™s execution. 
 *  It is considered the final method of a thread class.
 *  When the join() method is invoked, the current thread stops its execution and the thread goes into the wait state. 
 *  The current thread remains in the wait state until the thread on which the join() method is invoked has achieved its dead state. 
 *  If interruption of the thread occurs, then it throws the InterruptedException.
